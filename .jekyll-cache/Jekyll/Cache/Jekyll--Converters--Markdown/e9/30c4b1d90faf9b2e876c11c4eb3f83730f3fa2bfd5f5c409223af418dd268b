  <p>The following model will create laterals of ~16 feet at a 90 degree angle to the sanitary line. The inspection direction is not exported with the observations, so the model has to be run separately for the downstream inspections and the upstream inspections. The obervation points need to already be snapped to the sanitary lines.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>From WinCan - connect to the WinCan Map.</li>
  <li>Highlight the Observation points, then  Layer &gt; then Export, making sure to set the projection to 3735.</li>
  <li>In ArcGIS Pro - load the shapefile of the sanitary line layer that was used to create the WinCan project <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utl_sanitary_lines</code>.</li>
  <li>Add the observation points to Pro</li>
  <li>Add the following definition query to the observation points, adjusting the OBS_OPCODE to remove all non-taps - manholes, water level, misc observations
    <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">"OBS_OPCODE"</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">IN</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'AMH'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'MWL'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Select all the observation points that intersect the sanitary lines layer.</li>
  <li>Switch the selection, being sure to snap everything that did not snap to the sanitary lines layer. (Use integrate at your own risk.)</li>
  <li>Select the observations collected while running downstream.</li>
  <li>Run the Lateral_Creation ArcGIS Pro model in the WinCan_Models.tbx toolbox against these observations, leaving the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Downstream</code> checkbox checked</li>
  <li>Do the same for the upstream observations, unchecking the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Downstream</code> box</li>
  <li>Join the created laterals to the observation points on the OBS_PK field</li>
  <li>Copy over the DISTANCE field from the observations to the DISTANCE field in the laterals</li>
  <li>Copy over the OBS_OBSERV field to the NOTES field in the laterals</li>
  <li>Manually fill in the DIAMETER field</li>
  <li>Manually fill in the Status field with either “active”, “capped”, or “unknown” - active meaning it was dye tested to be active</li>
  <li>Manually fill in the VIDEO_TIME field and VIDEO_LINK field if necessary</li>
  <li>Manually fill in the PROJECT field (using the name of the WinCan project)</li>
  <li>Manually add the VIDEO_LINK to the AS YET UNKNOWN FIELD MAYBE INSPECT_LINK to the sanitary line layer (in QGIS)</li>
  <li>Append the laterals to the master utl_sanitary_laterals feature in the Enterprise database (in QGIS)</li>
</ol>
