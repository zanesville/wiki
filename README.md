## GIS Wiki

This site serves as the Wiki for the City of Zanesville GIS processes and procedures.

The site is a Jekyll template, served by GitHub. It uses Spectre CSS for the main styling, Tocbot for the heading menus and highlight.js for syntax highlighting.

Posts are found under the "/docs" folder, in their respective category folders under a "_posts" folder.

### There are six main categories

- Apps
- Data
- Projects
- Tasks
- Tips
- X-Archive

- Docs (this is technically a Jekyll category but is only used for keeping all the posts organized in one folder)
