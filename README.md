## GIS Wiki

This site serves as the Wiki for the City of Zanesville GIS processes and procedures.

The site is a Jekyll template, served by GitHub. It uses Spectre CSS and Tocbot for the heading menus.

---

### There are three main categories

- Projects
  - Main projects for GIS
- Docs (default - set in [config.yml](https://github.com/zanesville/wiki/blob/master/_config.yml))
  - Helpful hints and tricks
- Archive
  - Old projects and docs that might be of interest

The template is very sparse - categories are on the index page and soreted in reverse to get "Archive" to show up last, "Projects" to show up first and "Docs" in between.
